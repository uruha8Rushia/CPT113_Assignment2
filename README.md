## üîç Assignment Overview 
The objective is to design and implement a media or song player using C++, where **object-oriented doubly linked lists** play a core role in the application's functionality.

The application mimics a real-life scenario such as:
- **Music Playlist**: Storing and managing song lists using linked lists.
- **Journal/Diary**: Managing entries efficiently.
- **Event Planner / To-Do List**: Tracking tasks or events dynamically.

The program must:
- **Implemented in C++** using **object-oriented programming** principles.
- **Uses doubly linked lists** extensively for data storage and manipulation.
- **Requires an input file** to initialize the linked list.
- **Allows manipulation** of the list (adding, deleting, searching, editing entries).
- **Includes a UML diagram** illustrating class relationships.
- **Exception handling** using `try/catch` blocks.
- **Menu-driven interface** for user interaction.

## üí° Concepts Used
This project extensively applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Data Structures** concepts:

### Object-Oriented Programming:
- **Classes & Objects**: Encapsulation of relevant attributes and behaviors.
- **Inheritance**: Parent-child relationships to enhance code reuse.
- **Composition**: Objects as class members for strong relationships.
- **Friend Functions**: Allowing controlled access between classes.
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing operators for specific functionalities.
- **Encapsulation & Data Hiding**: Protecting private data members.

### Linked List Operations:
- **Doubly Linked List Implementation**:
  - **Initializing the list** from an input file.
  - **Adding nodes** dynamically.
  - **Editing node content**.
  - **Searching the list**.
  - **Deleting nodes** individually or destructing the entire list.
  - **Displaying nodes** and the full list.

### Additional Features:
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing back to an input file.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Menu-driven navigation for an intuitive experience.
- **Multiple File Inclusion**: Modular structure for enhanced readability.
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring correct data entry.

This project is designed to reflect **real-world programming principles**, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and functional correctness within an **object-oriented environment**.
